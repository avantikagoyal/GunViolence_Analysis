### Gun Violence Analysis

In this project, I am using three separate data files, each from a distinct source. The first one is a dataset compiling information on all gun violence incidents in the US from 2013-2018. The second dataset only looks at mass shooting incidents, but it covers years 1982-2019. The third dataset has information on gun ownership and suicide rate estimates from 1980-2016. 

1.	Gun Violence Dataset: https://github.com/jamesqo/gun-violence-data
2.	Mother Jones - US Mass Shootings: https://data.world/awram/us-mass-shootings
3. 	State-Level Estimates of Household Firearm Ownership: https://www.rand.org/pubs/tools/TL354.html
